# Reaify - **R**ewgs' **E**xtension for the Reaper **A**PI. 

A library that provides a more object-oriented approach for interacting with the Reaper API. Lua only.

The name is also a play on the word "reify," which is adjacent to "objectify," as well as a play on the fact that nearly every extension made for Reaper starts with the letters "rea."

Will eventually probably do a Python version called Reaipy.
