# Reaify - **R**ewgs' **E**xtension for the Reaper **A**PI. 

A framework that provides a more rapid, object-oriented approach for getting things done with the Reaper API. Lua only.

The name is also a play on the word "reify" (adjacent to the meaning of the word "objectify"), as well as a play on the fact that nearly every extension made for Reaper starts with the letters "rea."

Will eventually probably do a Python version called ReaiPy.
